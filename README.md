# PRNN-Assignments
Assignments for PRNN course at IISc,ECE Dept

All of them are Basic Scratch Implementations of common ML architectures including the backprop under respective folder:
1) Deep Neural Network
2) Convolutional Neural Network
3) Self-attention Transformer
4) Logistic Regression
5) Linear Regression

The file PRNN_A1_Q5 contains the following Implementations for a multi-class data given in the course:
1) Bayesâ€™ classifiers with 0-1 loss assuming Normal distribution for MLE estimate
2) General GMMs for class-conditional densities with coded up EM-algorithm
3) Parzen window with 2 different kernels
4) K-nearest neighbours with 2 different distance metrics
5) Linear classifier 1 vs Rest
