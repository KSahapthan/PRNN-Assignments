# PRNN-Assignments
Assignments for PRNN course at IISC,ECE Dept.

All of them are Basic Scratch Implementations of common ML architectures under respective folder.

The file PRNN_A1_Q5 contains the following Implementations:
1) Bayesâ€™ classifiers with 0-1 loss assuming Normal distribution for MLE estimate
2) General GMMs for class-conditional densities with coded up EM-algorithm
3) Parzen window with 2 different kernels
4) K-nearest neighbours with 2 different distance metrics
5) Linear classifier 0 vs R
